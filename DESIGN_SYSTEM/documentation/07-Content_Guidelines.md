# Content Guidelines

## Overview

Consistent, clear, and concise language is essential to creating an elegant and intuitive user experience. These guidelines define the voice, tone, and style for all UI text, including labels, descriptions, messages, and calls to action.

## Voice & Tone

Our voice is **clear, helpful, and professional**. We aim for a tone that is:

- **Concise:** Get straight to the point. Avoid jargon and unnecessary words.
- **Confident:** Speak with authority, but avoid being overly technical or boastful.
- **Respectful:** Address the user directly and politely.
- **Positive:** Frame actions and outcomes positively where possible, but be direct and informative about errors or limitations.
- **Modern & Elegant:** Language should feel current and align with the clean visual aesthetic.

**Examples:**

*   **Instead of:** *User must first select an item before proceeding.* -> **Use:** *Select an item to continue.*
*   **Instead of:** *Warning! An error occurred during file processing!* -> **Use:** *Couldn't process file. Please try again.*
*   **Instead of:** *Utilize the configuration options...* -> **Use:** *Use the settings...*

## Clarity & Conciseness

- **Use Simple Language:** Avoid technical jargon, acronyms (unless widely understood or defined on first use), and overly complex sentence structures.
- **Be Specific:** Clearly state what the user needs to do or what has happened.
- **Prioritize Key Information:** Place the most important information first.
- **Use Active Voice:** Prefer active voice over passive voice (e.g., "Save your changes" instead of "Changes should be saved").
- **Keep it Short:** Use short sentences and paragraphs. Limit text in buttons, labels, and tooltips.

## Grammar & Mechanics

- **Capitalization:**
    - Use **sentence case** for titles, headings, labels, menu items, and most UI text (Capitalize the first word and proper nouns only).
    - Use **title case** sparingly, primarily for main application titles or major section headers if deemed necessary for branding.
    - Button text should generally be sentence case (e.g., "Save changes", "Add item") unless it's a single, specific action word (e.g., "Save", "Cancel", "Delete").
- **Punctuation:**
    - Use periods at the end of complete sentences in descriptions, messages, and tooltips.
    - Avoid periods after short labels, button text, or list items unless they form a complete sentence.
    - Use standard punctuation correctly (commas, colons, etc.). Avoid excessive exclamation points.
- **Numerals:** Use numerals (1, 2, 3) instead of spelling out numbers in most UI contexts for brevity.

## Terminology

Use consistent terms for common actions and elements:

| Instead of                 | Use                    |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Submit, Execute, Go        | *Depends on context:* Apply, Save, Create, Run, Continue, OK |
| Modify, Change             | Edit                   |
| Terminate, Abort           | Stop, Cancel           |
| User, End-User             | You                    |
| Configure, Preferences     | Settings               |
| Data, Information          | *Be specific:* Files, Documents, Items, Settings, etc. |
| Click, Tap                 | Select, Choose         |

*(This list should be expanded as the project evolves)*

## Error Messages

- **Be Clear:** State what went wrong concisely.
- **Be Constructive:** If possible, explain *why* it happened and suggest a solution or next step.
- **Be Calm:** Avoid alarming or overly technical language.
- **Example:** *Couldn't save settings. Please check your network connection and try again.*

## Accessibility Considerations

- Ensure link text clearly describes the destination (e.g., "View account settings" instead of "Click here").
- Provide clear labels for all form inputs and controls.

*These guidelines provide a starting point. Refer back to the Core Design Principles, especially **Clarity Through Lightness** and **Focused Simplicity**, when writing any UI content.*
