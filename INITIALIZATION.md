## Initialization Status
- [ ] Project initialization completed

## Initialization Steps
When initialization is required (not marked as completed above):

1. Read the `PLANNING.md` file to understand the project architecture, tech stack, and file structure.
2. Create the base project structure according to `PLANNING.md`
3. Initialize package.json with required dependencies from `PLANNING.md`
4. Setup testing environment and configuration files. WE ONLY USE VITEST.
5. Add build/lint/test scripts to package.json
6. Create any necessary configuration files (.eslintrc, tsconfig.json, etc.)
7. Setup initial project files (index.html, entry points, etc.)
8. Read the `PLANNING.md` file to create a complete and thorough `TASK.md` file using `.cursor/rules/task_creation.mdc`
8. Mark initialization as complete by updating this file

## How to Use
1. The AI coding assistant should check this file before beginning any work
2. If initialization is not marked as complete, perform initialization steps based on PLANNING.md
3. After initialization is complete, update this file and mark the "Project initialization completed" checkbox
4. This initialization should only be performed ONCE per project
