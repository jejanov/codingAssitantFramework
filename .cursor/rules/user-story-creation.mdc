# User Story Creation

When creating or working with user stories, follow these guidelines:

## User Story Format

Each user story should follow this format:

```markdown
# US-[NUMBER]: [Title]

## User Story
**As a** [type of user]  
**I want** [feature/capability]  
**So that** [benefit/value]

## Background
[Provide any necessary context or background information]

## Acceptance Criteria

### Criterion 1: [Clear, testable statement]
- [ ] Given [precondition]
- [ ] When [action]
- [ ] Then [expected result]

### Criterion 2: [Clear, testable statement]
- [ ] Given [precondition]
- [ ] When [action]
- [ ] Then [expected result]

### Criterion 3: [Clear, testable statement]
- [ ] Given [precondition]
- [ ] When [action]
- [ ] Then [expected result]

## Design Notes
[Optional: Include any design considerations, wireframes, or mockups]

## Dependencies
[List any dependencies on other features, services, or user stories]

## Test Cases
[This section will be completed in the US-XXX-tests.md file]

## Implementation Tasks
[This section will be completed in the US-XXX-tasks.md file and reflected in TASK.md]
```

## Workflow Integration

User stories are the starting point for our Test-Driven Development workflow:

1. Create a new directory for the user story: `USER_STORIES/US-XXX-feature-name/`
2. Create the user story file: `US-XXX.md` using the format above
3. Define clear acceptance criteria using the Given/When/Then format
4. Create test cases in `US-XXX-tests.md` that map to these acceptance criteria
5. Create implementation tasks in `US-XXX-tasks.md` that map to test cases
6. Update `TASK.md` with these tasks organized by workflow phase

## Guidelines for Good User Stories

- Keep user stories focused on a single capability or feature
- Write acceptance criteria that are clear, specific, and testable
- Use the Given/When/Then format consistently
- Include all necessary context in the Background section
- For UI components, reference the design system in Design Notes
- Ensure acceptance criteria are complete before moving to test planning
- Use specific, measurable statements rather than vague requirements
