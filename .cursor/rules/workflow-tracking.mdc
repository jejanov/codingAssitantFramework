# Workflow Tracking

This guide explains how to track progress through our Test-Driven Development workflow.

## Workflow Phases 

Our TDD workflow consists of these phases:

1. **User Story Creation** - Defining requirements with acceptance criteria
2. **Test Planning** - Creating test cases mapped to acceptance criteria
3. **Task Planning** - Breaking down implementation into tasks
4. **TDD Implementation** - Following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
   - Red: Implementing failing tests
   - Green: Making tests pass with minimal code
   - Refactor: Improving code while keeping tests passing
5. **Verification** - Confirming all acceptance criteria are met

## Tracking Progress in TASK.md

The `TASK.md` file is the central place to track workflow progress:

```markdown
# Tasks

This document tracks current and completed tasks in the project, organized by user story and TDD workflow phase.

## Active User Stories

### User Story: US-XXX - [Title]
**Current Workflow Phase:** [User Story Creation | Test Planning | Task Planning | TDD Implementation | Verification]

#### Test Planning Tasks
- [ ] Create test cases for Criterion 1 (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Create test cases for Criterion 2 (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Create test cases for edge cases (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)

#### Implementation Tasks (Red Phase)
- [ ] Implement test file for Component A (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Implement test file for Component B (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Verify all tests are failing as expected (Red) (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)

#### Implementation Tasks (Green Phase)
- [ ] Implement Component A to pass tests (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Implement Component B to pass tests (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Verify all tests pass (Green) (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)

#### Implementation Tasks (Refactor Phase)
- [ ] Refactor Component A (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Refactor Component B (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Verify all tests still pass after refactoring (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)

#### Verification Tasks
- [ ] Verify Acceptance Criterion 1 is met (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Verify Acceptance Criterion 2 is met (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Update documentation (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
```

## Updating Workflow Status

As you progress through the workflow:

1. Update the "Current Workflow Phase" indicator in `TASK.md`
2. Check off completed tasks with completion dates
3. Add any discovered tasks to the "Discovered During Work" section
4. Move completed user stories to the "Completed User Stories" section
5. Update the user story document to mark acceptance criteria as complete
6. Add completed user stories to `USER_STORIES/COMPLETED.md`

## Workflow Reference

For a complete description of the workflow, refer to `/WORKFLOW.md`, which includes:
- Detailed workflow steps
- Visual workflow diagram
- Document structure 
- TDD cycle visualization

Always keep the workflow tracking up to date to ensure everyone understands the current state of development.
