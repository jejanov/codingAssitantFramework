# Project Initialization Check

This rule defines the process for checking and performing one-time project initialization.

## When to Apply

- At the beginning of any new project or feature
- Before starting any development work
- When the INITIALIZATION.md file indicates initialization has not been completed

## Initialization Process

1. **Check Initialization Status**
   - Read INITIALIZATION.md to determine if project has been initialized
   - Check if "Project initialization completed" is marked as complete

2. **If Not Initialized:**
   - Read PLANNING.md thoroughly to understand project requirements and architecture
   - Create necessary project directories as specified in PLANNING.md
   - Initialize package.json with required dependencies from PLANNING.md
   - Setup testing environment based on PLANNING.md specifications
   - Configure build tools and linters
   - Create configuration files (tsconfig.json, .eslintrc, etc.)
   - Update INITIALIZATION.md to mark initialization as complete
   - Record completion details in INITIALIZATION.md

3. **If Already Initialized:**
   - Skip initialization steps completely
   - Continue directly to User Story creation (Workflow step 1)

## Important Considerations

- Initialization should ONLY be performed ONCE per project
- Do not repeat initialization steps if already marked complete
- If in doubt whether initialization is needed for a sub-feature, check with the user
- Initialization may not be required for small features in existing projects
- Validate with user before installing dependencies or making major structural changes

## Implementation Example

```typescript
// Example code for checking initialization status
const checkInitializationStatus = async () => {
  const initializationFile = await fs.readFile('INITIALIZATION.md', 'utf8');
  return initializationFile.includes('[x] Project initialization completed');
};

// Example code for marking initialization as complete
const markInitializationComplete = async () => {
  let initializationFile = await fs.readFile('INITIALIZATION.md', 'utf8');
  initializationFile = initializationFile.replace(
    '- [ ] Project initialization completed',
    '- [x] Project initialization completed'
  );
  await fs.writeFile('INITIALIZATION.md', initializationFile);
};
```
