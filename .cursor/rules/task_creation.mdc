# Task Creation and Management

When creating or updating task lists, follow these guidelines to maintain consistency with our TDD workflow:

## Task Structure

- Tasks should be organized by user story and TDD workflow phase
- Each task should map to specific acceptance criteria and test cases
- Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks
- Include clear verification steps for each phase of the workflow

## Creating a New Task List

When creating a task list for a new feature:

1. Use the structure below, based on `USER_STORIES/TASK_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Organize tasks by TDD workflow phase (Test Planning, Red, Green, Refactor, Verification)
3. Include due dates for each task
4. Indicate the current workflow phase at the top of the user story section

# Tasks

This document tracks current and completed tasks in the project, organized by user story and TDD workflow phase.

## Active User Stories

### User Story: US-XXX - [Title]
**Current Workflow Phase:** [User Story Creation | Test Planning | Task Planning | TDD Implementation | Verification]

#### Test Planning Tasks
- [ ] Create test cases for Criterion 1 (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Create test cases for Criterion 2 (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Create test cases for edge cases (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)

#### Implementation Tasks (Red Phase)
- [ ] Implement test file for Component A (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Implement test file for Component B (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Verify all tests are failing as expected (Red) (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)

#### Implementation Tasks (Green Phase)
- [ ] Implement Component A to pass tests (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Implement Component B to pass tests (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Verify all tests pass (Green) (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)

#### Implementation Tasks (Refactor Phase)
- [ ] Refactor Component A (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Refactor Component B (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Verify all tests still pass after refactoring (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)

#### Verification Tasks
- [ ] Verify Acceptance Criterion 1 is met (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Verify Acceptance Criterion 2 is met (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Update documentation (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)

## General Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: [Description] (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Task 2: [Description] (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)

## Discovered During Work
- [ ] Task 1: [Description] (Added: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Task 2: [Description] (Added: YYYY-MM-DD)

## Completed User Stories

### User Story: US-XXX - [Title] (Completed: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [x] Test Planning: Created test cases for all acceptance criteria (Completed: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [x] TDD Implementation: Implemented all components with tests (Completed: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [x] Verification: All acceptance criteria verified (Completed: YYYY-MM-DD)

## Backlog
- [ ] User Story: US-XXX - [Title]
- [ ] General Task: [Description]
```

## Updating Task Status

- Update the "Current Workflow Phase" indicator as you progress through the workflow
- Check off tasks as they are completed, including the completion date
- Add any new tasks discovered during development to the "Discovered During Work" section
- Move completed user stories to the "Completed User Stories" section, with a summary of major phases completed
