# Project Planning and Architecture

When working with project planning and architecture documents, follow these guidelines:

## Project Vision & Architecture

The `PLANNING.md` file contains the high-level vision, architecture, tech stack, and success criteria for the project. When developing new features:

1. Verify that the feature aligns with the architectural principles in `PLANNING.md`
2. Follow the established tech stack and development standards
3. Ensure new components follow the file structure conventions
4. Consider the constraints and success criteria when making design decisions

## Integration with TDD Workflow

New features should be developed following our Test-Driven Development workflow:

1. Start by creating a user story in the `USER_STORIES` directory
2. Define clear acceptance criteria that align with the project's success criteria
3. Create test cases that validate the architectural principles 
4. Implement the feature according to the architectural guidelines
5. Document any architectural decisions or patterns used

## Architecture Documentation

When modifying or extending the project architecture:

- Update `PLANNING.md` to reflect the changes
- Ensure diagrams and visualizations are kept up-to-date
- Document the rationale behind architectural decisions
- Consider the impact on existing components and features
- Verify that changes maintain alignment with the project's vision and constraints

## Technology Constraints

Adhere to the technology constraints defined in `PLANNING.md`, including:

- Framework versions and dependencies
- Performance requirements
- Coding standards and patterns
- File structure and organization

This ensures consistency across the project and maintains the architectural integrity of the system.
