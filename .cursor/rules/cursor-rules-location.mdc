# Cursor Rules Location

Rules for placing and organizing Cursor rule files in the repository.

## Directory Structure

Cursor rule files must always be placed in the `.cursor/rules/` directory:

```
PROJECT_ROOT/
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
│       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
│       ├── another-rule.mdc
│       └── ...
└── ...
```

## Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `design-system-components.mdc`)
- Always use the `.mdc` extension
- Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose (e.g., `tdd-workflow.mdc`)

## Rule File Format

Each rule file should follow this format:

```
---
description: Brief description of the rule's purpose
globs: ["**/pattern/to/match/*.{ts,tsx}", "another/pattern/**/*"]
---

# Rule Title

Detailed guidance for when this rule applies...

## Section 1
- Important point 1
- Important point 2

## Section 2
- More detailed guidance...
```

## Implementation Guidelines

- Never place rule files in the project root
- Never place rule files in subdirectories outside `.cursor/rules/`
- When asked to create a new rule, always create it in `.cursor/rules/`
- Rules should be focused on a specific concern or file type
- Reference related documentation in rule content when applicable

## Creating New Rules

When creating a new rule, use the command:

```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/rules/
touch .cursor/rules/your-rule-name.mdc
```

Then edit the file with the appropriate content following the format above.
