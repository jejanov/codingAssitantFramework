For key slide content, refer to the slide_instructions folder which will contain individual markdown files for each slide. Each slide instruction file will follow this structure:
- Title: Clear, concise slide title
- Purpose: What this slide needs to achieve/communicate
- Key Message: The core message in 1-2 sentences
- Content: Detailed text content, bullet points, and quotes
- Visual Elements: Descriptions of images, diagrams, or charts to include
- Interactive Elements: Specific interactive components (typing animations, clickable elements)
- Animation Sequences: Step-by-step animations or transitions
- Audio Elements: Sound effects or narration cues
- Code Samples: Any code to display or animate
- Design Notes: Styling guidance specific to this slide
- User Interactions: How users can interact with the slide
- Transitions: How to enter and exit this slide

For slide content guidance, include a section on key slides that should be developed:
- Introduction to AI Coding Agents (with animated typing effect)
- Live Demo architecture slide (with interactive elements)
- Productivity metrics comparison (with animated visualizations)
- Integration workflow examples (with step-by-step animations)
- Prompt engineering best practices (with interactive examples)
- Business impact analysis (with data visualization)
- Real-world case studies (with before/after demonstrations)
- Q&A and resources slide

Each slide should incorporate one or more of these interactive elements:
- Simulated typing with typewriter-effect to show AI generating code
- Appropriate sound effects using howler.js (keyboard typing, success sounds)
- Smooth transitions with Framer Motion
- Interactive code examples with syntax highlighting
- "Build-up" animations that construct complex concepts piece by piece
