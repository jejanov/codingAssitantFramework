# US-001: Display First Slide Content

## User Story
**As a** Presenter
**I want** the application to load and display the content defined in `slide_instructions/slide_01.md`
**So that** the audience can see the first slide of the presentation.

## Background
The presentation application needs to dynamically load slide content from markdown files stored in the `slide_instructions/` directory. This story focuses on displaying the content of the very first slide.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Criterion 1: Load Slide Content
- [ ] Given the application starts
- [ ] When the main application component renders
- [ ] Then the content of `slide_instructions/slide_01.md` is fetched and stored in the application state.

### Criterion 2: Display Slide Title
- [ ] Given the content for `slide_01.md` has been loaded
- [ ] When the slide component is rendered
- [ ] Then the title defined in the slide's frontmatter is displayed prominently.

### Criterion 3: Display Slide Body Content
- [ ] Given the content for `slide_01.md` has been loaded
- [ ] When the slide component is rendered
- [ ] Then the main body content (markdown rendered as HTML) from the slide file is displayed below the title.

### Criterion 4: Handle Loading State
- [ ] Given the application starts
- [ ] When the content for `slide_01.md` is being fetched
- [ ] Then a loading indicator is displayed instead of the slide content.

### Criterion 5: Handle Error State
- [ ] Given the application starts
- [ ] When fetching the content for `slide_01.md` fails (e.g., file not found)
- [ ] Then an error message is displayed indicating the slide could not be loaded.

## Design Notes
- The visual presentation should be clean and simple for now.
- Refer to the `DESIGN_SYSTEM` for typography and basic layout components if needed.
- Basic styling (background, text color) is already applied in `App.tsx`.

## Dependencies
- None
