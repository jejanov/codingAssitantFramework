# Implementation Tasks for US-001: Display First Slide Content

**Maps to User Story:** [US-001](./US-001.md)
**Maps to Test Cases:** [US-001-tests.md](./US-001-tests.md)

## Overview
These tasks cover implementing the first slide of the presentation based on the specifications in `slide_instructions/slide_01.md`.

## Update to Implementation Approach

After clarification, we've pivoted from our initial approach. The original approach was to load and display markdown content directly from `slide_instructions/slide_01.md`. However, we now understand that the slide files contain **instructions for us** to build specific slide designs, not content to be displayed directly.

Our updated approach:
1. Read `slide_instructions/slide_01.md` to understand the requirements
2. Create a custom slide component based on those requirements
3. Integrate that component into the app
