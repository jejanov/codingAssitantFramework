# Implementation Tasks for US-002: Create "Introduction Code" Slide

**Maps to User Story:** [US-002](./US-002.md)
**Maps to Test Cases:** [US-002-tests.md](./US-002-tests.md)

## Overview
These tasks cover implementing the second slide of the presentation based on the specifications in `slide_instructions/slide_02.md`. This slide will feature a simulated IDE environment showing code being typed in real-time, followed by a translation panel that appears after the code animation completes.

## Task Breakdown

### Setup and Planning
- [x] Research the recommended Codeanimate library for code typing animations
- [x] Install necessary dependencies for code highlighting (Prism.js) and animations
- [ ] Set up audio files in the public directory for various sound effects

### Component Implementation
- [ ] Create `src/components/slides/Slide02.tsx` main slide component
- [ ] Implement the simulated IDE environment with VS Code styling
- [ ] Create `src/components/slides/CodeTyping.tsx` for code typing animations
- [ ] Create `src/components/slides/LineNumbers.tsx` for line numbers display
- [ ] Create `src/components/slides/StatusBar.tsx` for IDE status bar
- [ ] Create `src/components/slides/Minimap.tsx` for IDE minimap
- [ ] Create `src/components/slides/TranslationPanel.tsx` for the "Translation for Normal Humans" panel
- [ ] Implement syntax highlighting with Prism.js

### Audio Integration
- [ ] Create `src/hooks/useAudioEffects.ts` custom hook for audio management
- [ ] Implement keyboard typing sound effects
- [ ] Implement "success" sound when code is complete
- [ ] Implement "whoosh" sound for translation panel entrance
- [ ] Implement "pop" sounds for translation bullet points appearing

### Animation Implementation
- [ ] Implement code typing animation with realistic typing speed
- [ ] Add cursor blinking effect at appropriate pauses
- [ ] Implement translation panel slide-in animation
- [ ] Add bounce animation for translation bullet points
- [ ] Implement proper animation sequencing and timing

### Content and Styling
- [ ] Add the JavaScript code content from slide instructions
- [ ] Style the IDE environment with dark theme and proper fonts
- [ ] Style the translation panel with light theme and handwritten font
- [ ] Add subtle paper texture to translation panel
- [ ] Ensure all text is properly sized and readable

### Integration
- [ ] Update `App.tsx` to include Slide02 in the slide rotation
- [ ] Ensure proper navigation between slides
- [ ] Preload all audio assets for seamless playback

### Testing
- [x] Create test files as outlined in US-002-tests.md
  - [x] Create `tests/components/slides/Slide02.test.tsx` for IDE environment rendering tests
  - [x] Create `tests/components/slides/CodeTyping.test.tsx` for code typing animation tests
  - [x] Create `tests/components/slides/TranslationPanel.test.tsx` for translation panel tests
  - [x] Create `tests/hooks/useAudioEffects.test.ts` for audio effects tests
  - [x] Create `tests/components/slides/Slide02.animation.test.tsx` for animation sequencing tests
- [ ] Test IDE environment rendering
- [ ] Test code typing animation functionality
- [ ] Test translation panel appearance and styling
- [ ] Test audio integration
- [ ] Test animation sequencing
- [ ] Perform manual tests for visual and audio experience

### Verification
- [ ] Verify all acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Perform final quality check on animations and timing
- [ ] Ensure smooth transitions between slides
- [ ] Review for visual polish and professional appearance
