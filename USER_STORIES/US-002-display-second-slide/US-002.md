# US-002: Create "Introduction Code" Slide

## User Story
**As a** Presenter
**I want** the application to display a simulated code editor with animated typing and a translation panel as specified in `slide_instructions/slide_02.md`
**So that** the audience can see the story of AI coding evolution presented through code with a non-technical translation.

## Background
The second slide should present a narrative told through code being typed in real-time, with syntax highlighting and realistic typing animations. After the code animation completes, a "Translation for Normal Humans" panel should slide in with explanations for non-technical audience members.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Criterion 1: Simulated IDE Environment
- [ ] Given the slide is displayed
- [ ] When the audience views the slide
- [ ] Then a simulated IDE environment with dark theme, line numbers, and VS Code-inspired styling should be visible.

### Criterion 2: Code Typing Animation
- [ ] Given the simulated IDE is displayed
- [ ] When the slide animation begins
- [ ] Then the JavaScript code specified in `slide_instructions/slide_02.md` should appear to be typed in real-time with realistic typing speed, pauses, and cursor blinking.

### Criterion 3: Syntax Highlighting
- [ ] Given the code is being typed in the IDE
- [ ] When new code appears
- [ ] Then proper JavaScript syntax highlighting should be applied in real-time.

### Criterion 4: Translation Panel Animation
- [ ] Given the code typing animation has completed
- [ ] When the final line of code has been displayed
- [ ] Then a "Translation for Normal Humans" panel should slide in from the right with the content specified in the slide instructions.

### Criterion 5: Translation Panel Styling
- [ ] Given the translation panel appears
- [ ] When the audience views it
- [ ] Then it should have distinct styling from the code editor - light background, handwritten-style font, and a "sticky note" aesthetic.

### Criterion 6: Audio Integration
- [ ] Given the animations are playing
- [ ] When code is being typed or the translation panel appears
- [ ] Then appropriate audio effects should play (keyboard typing, success sound, whoosh, etc.) as specified in the slide instructions.

### Criterion 7: Animation Sequencing
- [ ] Given the slide is displayed
- [ ] When all animations run
- [ ] Then they should follow the specified sequence in the slide instructions, with appropriate timing and visual effects.

## Design Notes
- Follow the styling guidance in `slide_instructions/slide_02.md` closely.
- Consider using the recommended Codeanimate library or similar alternatives for the code typing animations.
- Make sure the code is readable and properly formatted with indentation.
- Add subtle details like a minimap and status bar to enhance the IDE simulation.
- Ensure the contrast between the technical code display and the casual translation panel is visually striking.
