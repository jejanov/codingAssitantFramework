# US-003: Display Productivity Visualization Slide

## User Story
**As a** presenter at the AI Coding Workshop  
**I want** to display a slide that visually demonstrates the productivity gains of AI-assisted development  
**So that** attendees understand the quantitative benefits and time savings that AI tools provide

## Background
This slide will be the third in the presentation sequence and focus on showing productivity metrics from Microsoft/MIT/Wharton research with engaging racing visualizations and timeline comparisons. It needs to clearly demonstrate the time reduction and productivity gains with compelling visuals.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Criterion 1: Slide structure and styling matches design guidelines
- [ ] Given the application is running
- [ ] When the user navigates to slide 3
- [ ] Then the slide should display with proper glassmorphism styling and hierarchy
- [ ] And the slide should have a title "Breaking the Speed Limit: The Multiplier Effect"
- [ ] And the background should match the gradient and styling of previous slides
- [ ] And subtle paper texture should be applied at low opacity

### Criterion 2: Racing visualization displays productivity comparison
- [ ] Given the slide is displayed
- [ ] When the racing animation begins
- [ ] Then two cars should be shown (traditional in red, AI-assisted in blue) 
- [ ] And the AI-assisted car should move significantly faster
- [ ] And the animation should include a countdown with audio cues
- [ ] And the race should conclude with a finish line effect and success sound

### Criterion 3: Productivity metrics are displayed with animations
- [ ] Given the race has started
- [ ] When the race progresses
- [ ] Then productivity metrics should appear with staggered timing
- [ ] And metrics should include: task completion speed (+55.8%), weekly tasks (+126%), PRs merged (+26%), production time (-50%)
- [ ] And metrics should animate with counting up effects and gauge visualizations
- [ ] And metrics should respond to hover with elevation changes

### Criterion 4: Timeline comparison visualizes project time reduction
- [ ] Given the race is 70% complete
- [ ] When the timeline comparison appears
- [ ] Then it should show traditional timeline (10 weeks) vs AI-augmented timeline (4.8 weeks)
- [ ] And each phase should be color-coded and labeled
- [ ] And the timeline should highlight "52% Time Reduction" as a key metric
- [ ] And timeline bars should fill progressively with animations

### Criterion 5: Audio elements enhance the experience
- [ ] Given audio is enabled
- [ ] When the slide animations play
- [ ] Then appropriate sound effects should play at key moments (countdown, race start, metrics achievements)
- [ ] And background ambient sound should continue from previous slides
- [ ] And all audio should be implemented using the useAudioEffects hook

### Criterion 6: Research citation is displayed
- [ ] Given the animations have completed
- [ ] When the race concludes
- [ ] Then a citation should appear crediting the Microsoft/MIT/Wharton research
- [ ] And the citation should fade in with subtle animation

## Design Notes
The slide should follow the glassmorphism design system established in previous slides, with proper hierarchy of glass components. Visual elements should use Regis brand colors consistently with previous slides.

## Dependencies
- Relies on the Glass component from the Design System
- Uses the useAudioEffects hook for sound management
- Requires the animation utilities established in previous slides
- Needs access to the sound and image assets in the public directory
