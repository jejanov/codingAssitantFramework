These are great! Now let's discuss the rest of the slide outline. Then we can come back and apply the Ethos, Pathos, Logs story telling across them.

Here are my high level thoughts for the pre-amble and agenda. We should likely start build a document to capture this and iterate on as a brain dump.  I would love to get your thoughts on this and see if you have anything to add to the preamble piece (i don't think that will be part of the presentation.  That will be me setting it up. once we have our brain dump document, we can start working on the slide documents. 

The reason this is important - The business is at a critical inflection point where we need to get more done with the same amount of resources as quickly as possible while at the same time continuing to deliver quality outcomes. This is upon us, we have to embrace it or we will be left behind. We should aspire to be and the bleeding edge of this and if we do, we will have the advantage and propel this business forward. We all know that our product is complicated to us and sell. It brings huge value or we wouldn't have the impressive client list that we have but if we are going to achieve critical mass we need to be accessible to a broader market faster at a time when we can't afford to hire more people; but serendipitously, AI not only has helped us get past a huge hurdle in the complexity of create content for simulations, it is also there ready for us to harness to execute on a vision for a product that takes that to a whole new level in a time frame that is immediate through the use of these AI tools. Imagine what it would mean if we could produce 1.25, 1.5, 2x what we can do today if we embrace this? 

Why I believe this, I'm a relative novice at software developed as compared to you guys and I have seen what these tools have allowed me to do. It has removed all of the encumbrances of syntax,  etc and given me the power to bring a vision (Bring customer value) to light exponentially faster than I would have been able to without it. Now, granted, it helps fill a bigger gap for me than it may for you, but it will help you over come former inherent laws of physics; you hands only type so fast, your brains can only hold on to so much in detailed complexity. AI can type at insane speed, and hold tons of complexity at the same time. I'm also excited by the thought of what this will do for you that it can't do for me as easily. I'm not an expert, AI helps me learn faster for sure, but i'm still weighted down by not knowing what I don't know. Where you guys, with your expertise in software design, architecture and development will be way more efficient in using these tools than I am because you will know what you want it do with less iteration. Lastly, I'm blown away at how easy it makes quality related things a relative breeze, TypeScript, JSDocs, and Unit Tests. If the only outcome of this were that we got those things at no extra effort, it would be a huge win. But the kicker is, we can have those things a little to no extra effort because the will save us in quality and because they help the AI do better and go faster for us. It's a crazy synergistic effect that few professions get to see very often. In our space, maybe the User interface, keyboards and mice? The microprocessor? The desktop computer. 

Now, I know I don't have to convince you. I didin't bring us together for that. I brought us together to level set, inspire each other, and ask you to help us become the leading edge AI Development team. I'm convinced that if we own the use of these tools and work as hard at becomes experts in that as we did the coding languages or architectures that we use every day that we will have a major impact on the near term success of this company and a whole lot of intriguing fun in the process.

Are you in?

So here is the agenda, first I want to share a presentation with you but in an unconventional way, we are going to make it on the fly and in doing so, i'm going to give you a brief and simple tutorial on how I've come to learn to use these tools. Then I'm going to show you a feature that i've worked on and give you a peak into what I was able to accomplish solo in a month. Then we are going to start the hackathon and start building out our projects using the framework / workflow that i'm going to introduce you to as a starting point. 

Presentation Slides:

Title Slide

Coding animation (as discussed)

Simple why slide on the statistics of what a 1.25, 1.5, 2x increase in productivity could bring. 

Simple why slide on why it maters to the business now

The big picture: Models, Context Management , Prompts

Models and Context - Models mater, but managing context is just as important and tools like Cursor.ai are built (much like our Rex tool) to manage context. Why does context mater so much? 

Agentic Work Flows - Why not all IDE's / tools are the same

What is a workflow and why does it mater?

Introduction to the tools

Introduction to the our baseline workflow ( a simple one)

Vision for the team (A carefully maintained set of workflows, prompts and tools that enable us to bring value to the market faster)
