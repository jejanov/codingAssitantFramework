## New Feature: Slide01 Enhancement
**Current Status:** Implementation Phase (Phase 0-3)

### Enhancement Summary
Based on feedback, we'll enhance Slide01 with more cutting-edge visual elements, focusing on improved logo presentation, glassmorphism text effects, and sophisticated particle animations. The goal is to create a truly state-of-the-art presentation with next-generation web technologies.

### Implementation Decision
We'll implement a modernized approach focusing on:
- Removing container panels in favor of floating glass-effect text
- Enhancing the Regis Company logo with dynamic effects
- Creating more sophisticated particle animations with fluid physics
- Adding subtle interactive elements for visual interest
- Implementing advanced WebGL, typography, and reactive elements
