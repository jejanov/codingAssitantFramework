# MermaidChart Component Code Review and Refactoring Plan

## Core Issues Analysis

Based on a thorough analysis of the MermaidChart component implementation, the following key issues have been identified:

1. **Multiple Overlapping Styling Layers**
   - Styling is applied at multiple levels with potential conflicts
   - Direct DOM manipulation competes with CSS classes
   - SVG attributes and CSS styles are both used for the same properties

2. **Scale Transformation Conflicts**
   - Multiple independent scale transforms applied through:
     - MermaidChart SVG attribute manipulation
     - CSS transformations in Slide04.css
     - View-specific scaling in different media queries

3. **Complex Container Hierarchy**
   - Multiple nested containers with redundant styling
   - Overflow handling issues across container boundaries
   - Inconsistent positioning and centering approaches

4. **Inconsistent Responsive Handling**
   - Mixed fixed heights and relative scaling
   - Inconsistent use of viewport units (vh, vw)
   - Different handling between fullscreen and standard modes
